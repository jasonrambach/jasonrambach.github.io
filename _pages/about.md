Jason Rambach received his Diploma in Computer Engineering degree from the University of Patras, Greece in 2012 and his M.Sc. in Information and Communication Engineering from the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany in 2014. In 2020, he received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Kaiserslautern for his dissertation entitled “Learning Priors for Augmented Reality Tracking and Scene Understanding”.

He has been at DFKI Augmented Vision in Kaiserslautern since 2015. Currently, he is a Senior Researcher leading the team “Spatial Sensing and Machine Perception” of approx. 10 researchers working on depth sensing and Geometric/Semantic scene understanding using Machine Learning.

His research interests include SLAM and Semantic Scene Understanding, Object Pose Estimation and Tracking, Anomaly Detection, Hybrid AI, Robotic Vision and Augmented Reality. He has over 30 publications in leading Computer Vision and Augmented Reality conferences, a best paper award from the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) 2017 and two awards at the BOP Object Pose Estimation challenge 2022 at ECCV. He is a reviewer for several scientific journals and conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICRA, WACV, BMVC). Since 2022 he is coordinator of the EU Horizon Project HumanTech, applying AI in the construction industry for Scan2BIM, Wearables and Assistance Robots.
