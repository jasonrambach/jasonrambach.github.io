Jason Rambach received his PhD in Computer Science in 2020 from the University of Kaiserslautern for his dissertation entitled “Learning Priors for Augmented Reality Tracking and Scene Understanding”. He has been at DFKI Augmented Vision in Kaiserslautern since 2015. Currently, he is a Senior Researcher and Deputy Director leading the team “Spatial Sensing and Machine Perception” working on Scene Perception and Reasoning using Machine Learning.

His research interests include Object Pose Estimation and Tracking, Semantic Scene Understanding, Anomaly Detection, Hybrid AI, Robotic Vision and Augmented Reality. He has over 50 publications in leading Computer Vision and Augmented Reality conferences, a best paper award from the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) 2017 and five awards at the BOP Object Pose Estimation challenge 2022 and 2023 at ECCV and ICCV. He is a reviewer for several scientific journals and conferences (CVPR, T-PAMI, ECCV, ICCV, ICRA, IROS, WACV, BMVC). Since 2022 he is coordinator of the EU Horizon Project HumanTech, applying AI in the construction industry for Scan2BIM, Wearables and Assistance Robots.
