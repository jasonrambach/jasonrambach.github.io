Our work in the <a href="https://www.vizta-ecsel.eu/">VIZTA research project </a> was focused on vision systems using exclusively time-of-flight (ToF) cameras.
The use of only-depth systems has several advantages such as privacy, generalization and creation of synthetic training data.
In VIZTA, we focused on two main application areas. In-car cabin and smart building.

We released two publically available datasets annotated ToF datasets, TICaM and TiMo, both available for download at <a href="https://vizta-tof.kl.dfki.de/">https://vizta-tof.kl.dfki.de/ </a>
