Jason Rambach received his PhD in Computer Science in 2020 from the University of Kaiserslautern (RPTU) for his dissertation entitled “Learning Priors for Augmented Reality Tracking and Scene Understanding”. He has been at DFKI Augmented Vision in Kaiserslautern since 2015. Currently, he is a Senior Researcher and Deputy Director leading the team “Spatial Sensing and Machine Perception” working on Scene Perception and Reasoning using Machine Learning.

His research interests include Object Pose Estimation and Tracking, Semantic Scene Understanding and Reasoning, Anomaly Detection, Hybrid AI, Robotic Vision and Augmented Reality. He has over 50 publications in leading Computer Vision and Robotics conferences, a best paper award from the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) 2017, five awards at the BOP Object Pose Estimation challenge 2022 and 2023 at ECCV and ICCV and an outstanding reviewer award from CVPR 2025. He is a reviewer for several scientific journals and conferences (CVPR, T-PAMI, ECCV, ICCV, ICRA, IROS, WACV, BMVC). From 2022 to 2025 he coordinated the EU Horizon Project HumanTech, applying AI in the construction industry for Scan-to-BIM, Wearables and Assistance Robots. He is also a coordinator for the euRobotics topic group Construction.
