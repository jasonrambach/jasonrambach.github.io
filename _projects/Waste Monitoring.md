Our paper, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11143212"> "ParticleSAM: Small Particle Segmentation for
Material Quality Monitoring in Recycling Processes"</a>, presents an adaptation of the SAM model for segmentation of extremely small particles at a very high density in images.
