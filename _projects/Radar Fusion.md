Radar sensors have a significant potential for several applications due to their low-cost and robustness to weather conditions.
However, their use in 3D-detection work is challenging due to the sparsity of 3D information compared to Lidar.

In our 2022 WACV paper <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/papers/Stacker_Fusion_Point_Pruning_for_Optimized_2D_Object_Detection_With_Radar-Camera_WACV_2022_paper.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com"> "Fusion Point Pruning for Optimized 2D Object Detection </a>
with Radar-Camera Fusion", we propose a method to optimize the neural network architecture for camera-radar fusion in 2D object detection:

In our ICPR 2020 publication <a href="https://www.dfki.de/fileadmin/user_upload/import/11198_Chamseddine2021Ghost.pdf">"Ghost Target Detection in 3D Radar Data using
Point Cloud based Deep Neural Network"</a>, we train a neural network to classify radar point cloud 3D points as normal or multi-path (ghost) detections:
